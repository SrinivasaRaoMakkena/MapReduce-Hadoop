# MapReduce-Hadoop

Our data set is based on Storm events, in which months and in which year the disaster was happened and how much damage has been occured like number of people were dead and cost of damaged property. 

Calculated number of deaths(Direct + Indirect) in each month of the year due to storm events by using
Hadoop Map-reduce algorithm and using Python language.

Calculated amount of property damaged due to storm events in each month of the particular year.
